# Logistic-Regression
the code uses libraries that introduced earlier to work with the dataframe, with partitioning training and testing data, producing logistic regression for categorical variables, and displaying the prediction value and its accuracy and contains the following procedures:

read csv files into dataframe | basic exploration of dataframe property | determine target & feature variables | check and handle missing values | plot count plots | convert categorical variables into dummy variables | partition data into training and testing data | fit training data into logistic regression | predict outcomes for the test set | get prediction's accuracy and confusion matrix

this piece more specifically focuses on reading the dataset into a dataframe; displaying dataframe' first several rows; exploring basic properties and determining the target and feature variables; droping irrelevant factors (feature selection); checking and handling missing values; ploting count plots; convert categorical feature variables into dummy variables; partitioning the data into train and test sets; fitting the training data to a logistic regression model; predicting the outcomes for the test set; displaying the model's accuracy and confusion matrix
